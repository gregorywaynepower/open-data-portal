      <h3>Embedding Content in Your Website via iframe</h3>
      <p>
        If you are going to use the "Embed" option <em>and</em> have the option
        to add raw HTML into your document or Content Management System, we
        recommend using the following snippet below. It will enable the
        <code>iframe</code> element to be able stretch to fit various screen
        sizes and not be limited by the <code>height</code> and
        <code>width</code> attributes of the <code>iframe</code>.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the snippet below, replace the <code>src</code> in the
        <code>iframe</code> with the <code>src</code> that is provided to you by
        the Embed component.
      </p>
