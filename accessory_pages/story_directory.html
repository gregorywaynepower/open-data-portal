            During a 13-week period from March 6 through June 2, 2023, Fred G.
            Bond Metro Park was the site of an exciting demonstration in
            driverless vehicle technology. The North Carolina Department of
            Transportation (<abbr>NCDOT</abbr>) partnered with Cary to bring an
            all-electric, automated shuttle to Bond Park. The Connected
            Autonomous Shuttle Supporting Innovation (<abbr>CASSI</abbr>) ran a
            1.6-mile, four-stop route from the Cary Senior Center to Bond Park
            Community Center on weekdays from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. during the
            pilot.

            Cary’s conservation strategy began in 1996, a time of extraordinary
            growth for the town, with the ambitious goal of reducing per person
            water usage by 20% by 2015. The vision was to support the high
            quality of life in Cary by continuing to provide safe and reliable
            water service, but also to steward our natural resources and
            infrastructure investments. That goal was met earlier than expected,
            with the 20% reduction mark hit by 2013. Remarkably, this
            conservation trend has continued with a reduction of 30% by 2023.
            Additionally, thanks to a steady reduction in maximum day demand,
            Cary was able to realize significant cost savings. Thanks to
            impressive community support, this successful journey included
            multiple droughts, cutting-edge technology, and significant shifts
            in both industry and development standards during its span.

            Solar energy is an important part of reducing carbon emissions and
            building a sustainable and resilient community. According to Cary's
            Land Development Ordinance, home solar installations, including
            photovoltaic cells and solar water heaters, are allowed everywhere
            in Cary. As part of Cary's commitment to excellence in
            sustainability, the installation of these solar systems is regulated
            by Cary's building permit process and reviewed for compliance with
            the LDO and North Carolina Building and Electrical Code. For more
            insight into the solar permits issued by Cary, view the solar
            dashboard by clicking the link below.

            In February 2020 Cary kicked off its Smart and Connected Community
            Stormwater Workshop. This 2-day workshop set out to create a
            scalable and repeatable architecture for near real-time alerting and
            visualization of rising storm water levels allowing for automated
            operational response and citizen notification, data sharing with
            regional partners as well as analysis and prediction of future
            events. In the almost 3 years since this first workshop Cary has put
            in place over 30 stream gages and 11 rain gages in the Swift Creek
            and Walnut Creek basins. Other town owned rain gages have also been
            incorporated to help build out this network.

            An idyllic, thriving community in the Triangle, Cary is ranked among
            the top regions in the country to live, work, or start a business.
            Its proximity to Research Triangle Park, ready land, and high
            quality of life, have resulted in rapid growth over the past few
            years. Cary's appeal lies in its beautiful homes, quaint shopping
            areas, and flourishing businesses tucked among tall groves of lush
            trees.

            In 2019, Cary partnered with Wake County to conduct a Waste
            Characterization Study, which estimated that 27.4% of Cary's
            single-family residential waste was food waste. In light of this
            study's results, Cary began work on a pilot Food Waste Recycling
            Drop-Off program to help the community divert food waste from the
            landfill and create compost.
