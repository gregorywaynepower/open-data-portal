          While most of today’s appliances are labeled as “high-efficiency,” it
          wasn’t always that way.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cary’s conservation strategy began in 1996, a time of extraordinary
          growth for the town, with the ambitious goal of reducing per person
          water usage by 20% by 2015. The vision was to support the high quality
          of life in Cary by continuing to provide safe and reliable water
          service, but also to steward our natural resources and infrastructure
          investments.
          <br />
          <br />
          That goal was met earlier than expected, with the 20% reduction mark
          hit by 2013. Remarkably, this conservation trend has continued with a
          reduction of 30% by 2023. Additionally, thanks to a steady reduction
          in maximum day demand, Cary was able to realize significant cost
          savings.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thanks to impressive community support, this successful journey was a
          success included multiple droughts, cutting-edge technology, and
          significant shifts in both industry and development standards during
          its span.
          <br />
          <br />
          This story honors the history, challenges, and successes of Cary's
          water conservation strategy and the way it continues to shape Cary
          today.

          As more people moved to Cary during the suburban boom of the early
          1990s, many new single family homes included irrigation systems
          installed to water lawns with thirsty fescue turf. A large, green lawn
          became a social normal. This expectation resulted in a dramatic
          increase in water demand, especially on hot summer days.
          <br />
          <br />
          Water Treatment and Reclamation Facilities are sized to handle peak
          day demand which means irrigation was driving the time and size of
          projected infrastructure needs. As Cary was planning for the future
          water system, it became clear that partnering with the community to
          reduce per capita usage was going to be necessary to sustainably
          steward our shared resources.

          With nearly 40 years of conservation history, we can't explore it all,
          but this story will share some of the highlights along the journey.
          The program was based on leading national programs in the Southwest
          and California. The comprehensive program grew quickly and adapted as
          needed. At its peak it, was directly administered by as many as six
          staff members.

          No one could have foreseen the record-breaking regional droughts

          The 2007-2008 drought caused significant regional attention. Many
          citizens voluntarily changed their habits (both indoor and outdoor) in
          ways that continue today.
          <br />
          <br />
          While Jordan Lake, Cary’s water supply, was stable, Cary briefly

        <p>
          Cary’s water conservation strategy became nationally recognized for
          its comprehensiveness and success. While sudden growth initially
          spurred this effort, the framework allows Cary to serve as a leader
          during times of regional drought.
          <br />
          <br />
          The success was a result of partnership from both individuals and the
          industry.
          <br />
          <br />
          After the drought, there was more societal appreciation and acceptance
          for warm-season turf. Additionally, with changing development
          patterns, irrigation systems no longer became standard fixtures in new
          homes. The irrigation industry advanced more efficient technologies
          such as soil moisture and rain sensors and urged industry
          professionals to design more efficient layouts.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, many new homes have significantly smaller yards on average,
          further reducing irrigation demand. Also, high-efficiency appliances
          have become standard for both new and older homes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Along with behavioral changes, all of these factors have contributed
          greatly to a reduction in per capita usage.
          <br />
          <br />
          As for the goal? We blew it out of the water with a 20% reduction
          realized years earlier than expected and over 30% reduction to date.
