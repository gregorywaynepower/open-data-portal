          Today, most appliances are labeled as “high-efficiency” but it wasn’t
          always that way.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cary’s conservation strategy began in 1996 with an ambitious goal at a
          time of extraordinary growth of reducing per person usage by 20% by
          2015. The vision to was to support the high quality of life in Cary by
          continuing to provide safe, and reliable water service, but also to
          steward well both our natural resources and the infrastructure
          investments.
          <br />
          <br />
          That goal was met earlier than expected, achieving a 20% reduction by
          2013. Remarkably, the conservation trend has continued with a
          reduction of 30% by 2023. Additionally, thanks to a steady reduction
          in maximum day demand, Cary was able to delay the expansion of two
          water treatment facilities, resulting in significant cost savings.
          <br />
          <br />
          The journey included impressive community support, multiple droughts,
          cutting-edge technology, and significant shifts in both industry and
          development standards.
          <br />
          <br />
          This story honors the history, challenges and successes of Cary’s
          water conservation strategy and the way it continues to shape Cary
          today.

          As more people moved to Cary in the suburban boom of the early 1990s.
          Many of the single family homes came with irrigation systems installed
          to water lawns with thirsty fescue turf. A large and green lawn became
          a social normal. This expectation resulted in a dramatic increase in
          water demand, especially on hot summer days.
          <br />
          <br />
          Water Treatment and Reclamation Facilities are designed to handle peak
          day demand which means irrigation was driving the time and size of
          projected infrastructure needs. As Cary was planning for the future
          water system, it became clear that partnering with the community to
          reduce per capita usage was going to be necessary to sustainably
          steward our shared resources.
