            Solar energy is an important part of reducing carbon emissions and
            building a sustainable and resilient community. Cary is committed to
            exceptional service in all things, including solar installation.
            According to Cary's Land Development Ordinance home solar
            installations, including photovoltaic cells and solar water heaters,
            are allowed everywhere in Cary. The installation of these solar
            systems is regulated by Cary's building permit process and reviewed
            for compliance with the LDO and North Carolina Building and
            Electrical Code. Follow the link to a dashboard on the solar permits
            that go out of Cary's doors.

            In February 2020 Cary kicked off its Smart and Connected Community
            Stormwater Workshop. This 2-day workshop set out to create a
            scalable and repeatable architecture for near real-time alerting and
            visualization of rising storm water levels allowing for automated
            operational response and citizen notification, data sharing with
            regional partners as well as analysis and prediction of future
            events. In the almost 3 years since this first workshop Cary has put
            in place over 30 stream gages and 11 rain gages in the Swift Creek
            and Walnut Creek basins. Other town owned rain gages have also been
            incorporated to help build out this network.

            An idyllic, thriving community in the Triangle, Cary is ranked among
            the top regions in the country to live, work, or start a business.
            Its proximity to Research Triangle Park, ready land, and high
            quality of life, have resulted in rapid growth over the past few
            years. Cary's appeal lies in its beautiful homes, quaint shopping
            areas, and flourishing businesses tucked among tall groves of lush
            trees.

            In 2019, Cary partnered with Wake County to conduct a Waste
            Characterization Study, which estimated that 27.4% of Cary's
            single-family residential waste was food waste. In light of this
            study's results, Cary began work on a pilot Food Waste Recycling
            Drop-Off program to help the community divert food waste from the
            landfill and create compost.

            recreational activities, and one of the highest median household
            incomes in all of North Carolina. With all of Cary's accolades, it's
            no wonder the region's real estate market is booming.

            an event cancellation, an all-staff email from their boss, their
            child's school going virtual. For many, it had already hit home by
            the time Governor Roy Cooper issued Executive Order 121 on March 27,
            2020, implementing a statewide Stay at Home Order set to begin three
            days later on Monday, March 30.

                        The opioid epidemic is affecting communities throughout the nation, and Cary is no exception. 
                        In 2017, the Town saw a 40% increase in fatal overdoses and a 135% increase in non-fatal overdoses over the previous year.
                        In 2015, there were more than 1,100 opioid-related deaths, including 62 in Wake County. North Carolina more broadly has 
                        experienced a 73% jump in opioid-related deaths since 2005. To address this challenge, Town of Cary took a novel and innovative data centric approach.
