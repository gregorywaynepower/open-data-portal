## Opendatasoft & Bootstrap

- Opendatasoft uses [Bootstrap](https://discovery.opendatasoft.com/pages/concept-responsive/) as a front-end framework.
- Version of Bootstrap may change, [here is a more comprehensive source of documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/)
- For their visualizations, there is the [ods-widgets](https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-widgets)
- Additional dependencies and libraries they import for their charts, they use [Highcharts JS v6.1.4](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/changelog/#highcharts-stock-v6.1.4) in our theme
